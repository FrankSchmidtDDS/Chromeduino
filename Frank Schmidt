Looking to use Chromeduino as an introduction to Arduino and various hardware (boards et.) and Chromebooks for schools,
after school clubs and "discovery centers". I have downloaded the first two "Examples" repositories from Arduino Create Web Editor
to file folders which include the .ino sketches for "Basics" under Examples. And also include Fritizing diagrams of the R3 Uno. 
I have proven to myself 
that these file folders can be uploaded to a Google Chrome repository and from there installed on Chromeduino, at least if no complex 
libraries are included in the sketches and then uploaded sucessfully to my Arduino Uno R3 using a  Chromebook and Chromeduino. 
I will now proceed to post these first two Basics (1) and (2) folders on the Google Drive account and share them here. There maybe time
to make YouTube videos tutorials and a sub-Reddit community on this method. 

Thank you for developing Chromeduino. I would like to ask
if there are other boards supported besides the Uno R-3 and which , if any libraries are supported.
